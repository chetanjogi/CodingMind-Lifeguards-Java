# Coding Minds – Lifeguards (Java)

This repository is part of my Instructor Application Bootstrap Project for Coding Minds Academy.

## Contents
- `Lifeguards.java`  
  Brute-force Java solution for the USACO Bronze “Lifeguards” problem.

- `LifeguardsOptimized.java`  
  Optimized Java solution using sorting and sweep-line logic with O(N log N) time complexity.

- `slides/`  
  Teaching slides (exported from GoodNotes) used to explain the problem, logic, and optimization in a classroom-style format.

## Teaching Approach
The solutions are written with clarity and readability in mind, focusing on:
- Step-by-step problem understanding
- Simple comparisons and logic
- Clean Java code suitable for K–12 students
- Explanation of time and space complexity
- Transition from a basic solution to an optimized approach

## Language
Java

## Topic
Algorithms / USACO (Bronze → Optimized)
